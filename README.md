# Project Title

## Introduction
This project includes a series of Python scripts for data preprocessing, cross-validation, model training, evaluation, and visualization, focusing on Elastic Net and Linear Regression models.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn

### Setup
Install the required libraries using:
```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```


## File Descriptions
- `data_preprocessing.py`: Functions for data preprocessing, including standardization.
- `cross_validation.py`: Custom cross-validation functionality.
- `elastic_net_model.py`: Elastic Net regression model implementation.
- `linear_regression_model.py`: Linear Regression model implementation.
- `plotting.py`: Functions for plotting model results.
- `consolidated.py`: Integrates multiple functionalities for a unified workflow.
- `main.py`: Main runner script using command-line arguments for experiment execution.

## Usage
Run experiments using `main.py`. This script accepts command-line arguments to specify the data file and the desired operations.
